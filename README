lxSplit for Unix (Linux, BSD, ...) version 0.2.4

http://lxsplit.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxsplit/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This utility is used to split up huge files into smaller pieces without
compression.  It can be used to join the splitted pieces back into the
original file.  LXSplit is fully compatible with HJSplit which is a free
tool available for other operating systems (see http://www.freebyte.com)

Installation is easy, just run:
 make
 make install

The program will be installed as "lxsplit" in /usr/local/bin by default.
If you wish to install it elsewhere, edit the Makefile, and change the
'INSTALL_PATH'.

LXSplit splits and merges files with the -s and -j flags respectively.
Starting with version 0.2.1, LXSplit can handle large files (>= 4 GB)
both when splitting and joining.

Example:
To split a big file into smaller pieces of 15 MB each, run the following
command:

 > lxsplit -s hugefile.bin 15M

Output size can be given in (M)egabytes, (k)ilobytes and (b)ytes.

To merge (join) the already split pieces into the original big file, run
this command:

 > lxsplit -j smallfiles.bin.001

All resulting files (from either splitting or joining) will be placed in
the current directory.
